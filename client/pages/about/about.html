            <p>
                Sleep is an important component of a person’s physical and mental wellbeing.
                <br>
                <b>33% of adults</b> don’t sleep the recommended 7-8 hours each night
            </p>
            <p>why?
                <br>
                A variety of factors like: higher work demands, stress, and technology
            </p>

            <p>Sleep deprivation is known to affect a person’s daily living. It takes a toll in almost every public
                indicator such as mortality, accidents and injuries, quality of life, and even simple healthcare
                utilization</p>
            <h2 class="mt-5"><b>How can music help?</b></h2>
            <p>
                <br>
                Music therapy has been tried and researched in helping people with a history of sleeping disorders.
                Simple musical elements like repetition, rhythm, and tune can help the mind relax.
            </p>

            <p>
                Music could be the solution to helping individuals sleep better at night.
                <br>
                <b>But...</b>
                <br>
                Music is a very subjective and diverse category. This makes it difficult to create a general solution
                for
                everyone. That is why we at RestRhythm aim to create a sleeping music environment tailored to you and
                your
                needs.
            </p>

            <h2 class="mt-5"><b>What exactly is RestRhythm?</b></h2>
            <p>RestRhythm is a music based website that is aimed at helping sleep deprived young adults customize their

                soundscapes on top of the music of their choice.
